# ML-water-potability

# Overview 
This Water Potability Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether water is safe for consumption or not, based on various water quality features. By analyzing a dataset containing key parameters such as pH, hardness, turbidity, and organic carbon levels, the model classifies water samples as either potable(drinkable) or non-potable(not drinkable). This project employs Python-based data analysis and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model, which is then deployed using Docker for easy distribution and scalability.

## Why This Problem Matters
Access to clean water is a fundamental necessity for human health and well-being. Contaminated water causes diseases and deaths worldwide, especially in developing regions. Machine learning can help detect unsafe water early, which can assist authorities and organizations in taking timely action, ultimately improving public health and quality of life. This project aims to contribute to the broader goal of improving access to clean and safe drinking water by providing an automated solution for water quality assessment.
